                                    I met Julias Ajida through a friend in April of 2014. We then became very good
                                    friends and talking on daily basis. Little did I know that he would be my Sponono in
                                    few months. We then met in August the 15th of the same year in Woking. A year later
                                    on
                                    the 15th of August we had our first born. He makes me laugh, very caring, patient,
                                    my
                                    king charming, gives me hope and my compassion. You have given me so much love and
                                    encouragement that I don‚Äôt think I will be able to return all that to you. You have
                                    been lighting up the dark and bringing joy to my heart.

                                    My prayer had always been to marry someone who loves me and respect my parents of
                                    which I got more than I asked for from God.

                                    He then proposed on the August 2017.


                                    21st of April was our traditional marriage .


                                    4th of October was Civil wedding

                                <p class="inner-text"><span class="quote">&#10077;</span>
                                    It was the beginning of 2014 when I met Tsitsi my Rose üåπ of Sharon through my
                                    childhood friend Vincent.
                                    We exchanged phone numbers and it blossomed from there onwards. Since I couldn‚Äôt see
                                    her regularly due to work and distance, I knew I had to stay relevant in her
                                    heart therefore I quickly realised that Tsitsi had a great sense of humour which I
                                    tried to use to
                                    my advantage. I developed a plan of making sure that everyday I had to come up with
                                    a
                                    joke which will continually stay in her head in my absence. Even though our
                                    backgrounds were different it was obvious that the love we had for each other was
                                    bigger than everything else. As times goes on slowly but surely we were both head
                                    over heels and we never looked back.
                                    Tsitsi is a great person,a special mum to my daughter and I, my best friend, the
                                    love of my life, the one I cannot live without and someone I adore very much.
                                    Exactly a year after we first met we were blessed with our beautiful daughter Renee
                                    Aisha Ajida who we both adore very much.
                                    I then proposed to Tsitsi in August 2017
                                    We had our traditional marriage on 21st April.
                                    4th of October was civil wedding leading to the big day on the 27th of June 2019
